I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year PhD student at [Insight SFI Centre of Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org) at Dublin City University (DCU), Ireland. I am supervised by [Dr. Kevin McGuinness](https://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~mcguinne/) and [Prof. Noel O'Connor](https://www.insight-centre.org/our-team/prof-noel-oconnor/). My research interests lies in computer vision and machine learning specifically self-supervised learning and conditional computation.

Prior to starting PhD, I finished Masters in Artifical Intelligence from University of Amsterdam (UvA), Netherlands. I was supervised by [Mert Kilickaya](https://kilickaya.github.io) during my master thesis at [QUvA Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/quva/). 


**NOTE :** *Commencing in early 2024, I will be actively exploring job opportunities, with a keen interest in  industrial Postdoc positions or roles as an applied researcher/scientist in the industry*.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
